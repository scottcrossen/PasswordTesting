# Password Strength Testing

A computer security demonstration

### Description

This produces shadow and passwd files for various passwords which can then be used by projects like "jack the ripper" to test
how long it takes to crack the password. A docker-build system is included for cross-platform development and isolation. It also faciliates the rebuilding process whenever a change is made to source files.
